# GPT Companion Project

Welcome to the GPT Companion Project! This project is a fun and experimental application that leverages GPT-4 to create an interactive companion experience. It is currently in its early stages of development.

## Overview

This project consists of two main components:

1. **Frontend**: Built using React, providing the user interface and handling interactions.
2. **Backend**: Handles API calls to integrate with GPT-4.

## Features

- Interactive conversational experience using GPT-4.
- Basic API calls to fetch responses from the backend.
- Early-stage functionality, with room for improvement and expansion.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gpt-companion-project.git
    cd gpt-companion-project
    ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Project

1. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    node index.js
    ```

2. Start the frontend application:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` and for the backend its on port `3001`.

## Usage

Interact with the GPT companion through the frontend interface. The backend will handle the requests and provide responses based on GPT-4.
